# How It Works
```
I didn't make any stylistic changes to the layout of the website except for adding underlines to the options on the nav bar because I feel when I see underlines it means it is a clickable option. Otherwise in the html code I cleaned up the working tree by adding some spaces to make it more readable and clean at a glance, changed some semantic tags, and tidied up some code here and there. Since I changed some elements in the html I needed to change the css stylesheet to agree with the new code; in doing so, I was able to consolidate some redundant css commands and delete them by using element tags instead of class tags for everything. I also did my best to layout the code in a way that makes sense for someone to look at top to bottom and see the logical workflow of the site.

# User Story
```
Someone goes to the website and sees and clean nav bar at the top and a large inviting photo of a team of business people working on a project. Click any of the underlined options on the nav and the user will be taken to the text boxes down below on the page where they can view three different blurbs about the company and what they do with smaller pictures and headers that match the nav bar options. To the right of these blurbs is a side bar with more info and images to accompany them. At the bottom is a clean copyright that is centered to the page.
